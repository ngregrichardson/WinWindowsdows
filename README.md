# WinWindowsdows
Ever wanted a window inside of Windows? Look no further.
## About
Look, we all know why we use Windows. It clearly states in the name that windows will be a part of it. And trust me, I know the feeling of when you boot up Windows for the first time and realize that the "windows" they are referring to are just blobs of text and images across your screen.

All you wanted was to look at your computer screen through a window without having to put it outside while sitting inside (weather damage, as it turns out, isn't ideal for computers), but alas, even a company as big and rich as Microsoft couldn't make that happen.

Well, lucky for you, WinWindowsdows is here. WinWindowsdows is a simple program that makes your entire Windows experience better by putting it behind a virtual window. We thoroughly tested this product with hundreds of thousands of people to re-create a perfect realistic window inside of Windows*. Enjoy!
